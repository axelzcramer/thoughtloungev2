Holy smokes! You're a host! This email is confirming that your application to be a host for TL at Cal has been approved, and your profile on thoughtlounge.org has been updated to a host profile instead of a lounger profile. This means you can create new thought lounges on the site, log your synopses, and various other cool things. But if you've been chosen to be a host you already know all this! 

Cool,
Axel
